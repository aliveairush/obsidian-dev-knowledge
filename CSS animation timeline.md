Regret but it is not supported in Safari , so still waiting,

But when it will be added we could use such things as here 
https://scroll-driven-animations.style/

To understand how it works better we should test some values in https://scroll-driven-animations.style/tools/view-timeline/ranges/#range-start-name=cover&range-start-percentage=0&range-end-name=cover&range-end-percentage=100&view-timeline-axis=block&view-timeline-inset=0&subject-size=smaller&subject-animation=reveal&interactivity=clicktodrag&show-areas=yes&show-fromto=yes&show-labels=yes
