type ITWorkersAutocomplete = 'Frontend' | 'Backend' | 'QA' | (string & {}); // Magic  
  
/**  
 * @param a - is considered as string  
 * @param b - is considered as  'Frontend' | 'Backend' | 'QA' but u could also provide a string  
 */function typedFn(a: ITWorkers, b: ITWorkersAutocomplete) {

// Or just with type  
type LooseAutocomplete<T extends string> = T | Omit<string , T>
