```ts
type ValueOptional = {  
  props: string | undefined;  
}  
  
type KeyOptional = {  
  props?: string;  
}  
  
// ✅ VALID but we prbbly would like to know that when we use it somewhere else// we know that this value exists, and if it is important enough prblby we should  
// stick to ValueOptional types rather KeyOptional  
const example1 : KeyOptional = {}  
  
// ❌  WONT COMPILE - So prefer to specification// const example2: ValueOptional = {}
```
